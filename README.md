# TeleRehab-I4
Health Care Institutions in Colombia are geographically distributed in an irregular manner. The entities that provide specialized services, such as physical rehabilitation, are concentrated in the main cities. Therefore, although the coverage of the Colombian health system has increased in recent years, barriers to access to health services, such as geographic vulnerability and the cost of transportation to rehabilitation centers, continue to be a problem that is felt in the country. For this reason, this project presents a control system for the teleoperation, via internet, of a technological aid for physical rehabilitation of the knee based on the industry 4.0 model. For this, a design methodology is proposed that integrates several resources and tools from various areas, mechanical, electronic and information technology, such as SysML, distributed control, databases, rehabilitation device, among others. As a result, a functional prototype of the system is achieved that will allow to technically evaluate an infrastructure that allows patients to perform their procedures without moving long distances from their place of residence. In addition, the implementation of the Industry 4.0 model will allow to have an integral vision of the system, facilitating a later scalability of the project such as the implementation of a predictive maintenance program.
